1. Performance on the development data with 100% of the training data
1a. spam precision: 0.993
1b. spam recall: 0.978
1c. spam F1 score: 0.985
1d. ham precision:0.947
1e. ham recall: 0.983
1f. ham F1 score: 0.965

2. Performance on the development data with 10% of the training data
Manually selected 10% of the entire data set, of which 50% were from ham and 50% from spam
2a. spam precision: 0.990
2b. spam recall: 0.968
2c. spam F1 score: 0.980
2d. ham precision: 0.926
2e. ham recall: 0.978
2f. ham F1 score: 0.951

3. Description of enhancement(s) you tried (e.g., different approach(es) to smoothing, treating common words differently, dealing with unknown words differently):
I modified the original script to “nbclassify-task3.py”. This script will ignore the tokens that are of length less than or equal to 2, most of them being common english stop-words. These words are deleted from the respective ham dict and spam dict.  Then performed add-one smoothing on the probabilities.

4. Best performance results based on enhancements. Note that these could be the same or worse than the standard implementation.
4a. spam precision: 0.997
